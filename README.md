### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was adopted to efficiently plan, execute, and iterate development for Fly Wheels. A GitHub Project Board and a user story template were used throughout the project lifecycle.
* Epics were defined to group user stories under broader goals (e.g., Product Browsing, Cart & Checkout, User Authentication).
* User Stories were written in the format:
As a [user], I can [action] so that [goal] ‚Äî with clear acceptance criteria.
* The GitHub Project Board was made public to track progress across columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
* Labels (Bug, Enhancement, Testing, Priority) were applied to issues for visibility and prioritization.
* Iterative development ensured continuous improvements based on testing feedback and alignment with user experience goals.
