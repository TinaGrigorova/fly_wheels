### Project Goals

The goal of the Fly Wheels project is to provide users with a modern, accessible, and engaging e-commerce platform for exploring and purchasing high-quality alloy and track edition wheels. The project focuses on simplifying the shopping experience while offering clear product information, category separation, and dynamic cart functionality. By centralizing product browsing, filtering, and checkout processes, Fly Wheels aims to deliver a professional and user-friendly online shop for car enthusiasts.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was adopted to efficiently plan, execute, and iterate development for Fly Wheels. A GitHub Project Board and a user story template were used throughout the project lifecycle.
* Epics were defined to group user stories under broader goals (e.g., Product Browsing, Cart & Checkout, User Authentication).
* User Stories were written in the format:
As a [user], I can [action] so that [goal] ‚Äî with clear acceptance criteria.
* The GitHub Project Board was made public to track progress across columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
* Labels (Bug, Enhancement, Testing, Priority) were applied to issues for visibility and prioritization.
* Iterative development ensured continuous improvements based on testing feedback and alignment with user experience goals.

## Security Features

### User Authentication
* Implemented using Django Allauth, which handles user registration, login, logout, password reset, and account management securely.
### Login Decorator
* Views related to cart, checkout, and order history are protected using Django‚Äôs @login_required decorator.
* This ensures only authenticated users can perform sensitive actions such as placing an order or viewing order history.
### CSRF Protection
* Django provides built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
* CSRF tokens are embedded in all forms to ensure only legitimate requests are processed.
* When a user logs out, their session and CSRF token are invalidated automatically, reducing security risks.
### Form Validation
* All checkout and cart update forms use Django‚Äôs built-in form validation mechanisms.
* This includes required fields, input type enforcement, and feedback for invalid or missing data.
* Additional validation ensures that only valid products and quantities are submitted to the backend.
### Custom error pages
* Custom 404 (Page Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) templates are implemented to improve user experience.
* These pages display friendly messages and provide navigation options back to the homepage or shop.

## Deployment and Local Developement

Live deployment can be found on this [View live website here]()

### Local Developement

#### How to Fork
1. Log in(or Sign Up) to Github
2. Go to repository for this project[Track Day]([https://github.com/TinaGrigorova/fly_wheels])
3. Click the fork button in the top right corner

#### How to Clone
1. Log in(or Sign Up) to Github
2. Go to repository for this project [Track Day]([https://github.com/TinaGrigorova/fly_wheels])
3. Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type the following command in the terminal (after the git clone you will need to paste the link you copied in step 3 above)
6. Set up a virtual environment (this step is not required if you are using the Code Institute Template in GitPod as this will already be set up for you).
7. Install the packages from the requirements.txt file - run Command pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### ElephantSQL Database
[Track Day](https://github.com/TinaGrigorova/fly_wheels) is using [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) PostgreSQL Database

1. Click Create New Instance to start a new database.
2. Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
3. Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan.
4. You can leave the Tags blank.
5. Select the Region and Data Center closest to you.
6. Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Heroku Deployment
* Log into [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account or create an account.
* Click the "New" button at the top right corner and select "Create New App".
* Enter a unique application name
* Select your region
* Click "Create App"

#### Prepare enviroment and settings.py
* In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
* Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
* Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
* Comment out the default database configuration.
* Save all files and make migrations.
* Add the Cloudinary URL to env.py
