## Bugs 

### Present Bugs

- **Real email delivery fails (production SMTP)**
  - **Status:** Open (known limitation)
  - **Observed:** Order/notification emails are not delivered when using real SMTP providers in production. Works perfectly with Mailtrap (testing).
  - **Repro:** Place an order with production SMTP configured; logs show SMTP/auth errors or timeouts; no email received.
  - **Attempted:** Gmail (with app password), Mailchimp Transactional, and other SMTP providers; correct TLS/port (587), environment variables on Heroku, different from-addresses. Unfortunately, the fix is currently beyond my scope.
  - **Likely cause:** Provider restrictions and/or missing domain DNS records (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) that require verified domain ownership and DNS changes.
  - **Mitigation:** Email sending is wrapped in `try/except` so orders still complete; the UI shows a non-blocking warning toast if email fails. Mailtrap remains enabled for reliable test sends.

| `relation "store_newsletter" does not exist` after subscribing                         | Created `Newsletter` model, ran `makemigrations` & `migrate`; added CSRF and proper POST route.                                                 |
| `NoReverseMatch: 'newsletter-subscribe'`                                               | Added URL pattern `path('newsletter/subscribe/', ...)` and updated footer form `action`.                                                        |
| ImportError in sitemap after removing `Category` model                                 | Removed `CategorySitemap` and the `Category` import, kept `ProductSitemap` + static sitemap only.                                               |
| `TemplateSyntaxError` “block tag with name 'meta\_description' appears more than once” | Consolidated/renamed meta blocks in `base.html` (separate `meta_description` and `og_description`), leaving each block defined once.            |
| Sign-up template used Allauth routes (`account_signup`, `account_login`)               | Replaced with Django auth routes (`signup`, `login`) and updated form `action`/links.                                                           |

| Unwanted debug link printed above hero collage                                         | Removed stray debug anchor from the template and moved canonical URL to a `<link rel="canonical">` in `<head>`.                                 |
| Git push rejected (remote ahead)                                                       | Resolved via `git pull --rebase origin main`, then `git push`.                                                                                  |

## Manual Testing
 * Core Features Tested — Fly Wheels (Django e-commerce)
1) User Registration & Login
  * Created a new account via /accounts/signup/ with valid username & password → user auto-logged in, toast shown.
  * Logged in via /accounts/login/ with valid credentials → success, redirect respected ?next=.
  * Invalid login (wrong password) → form errors rendered; CSRF token present; no redirect loop.
  * Logout POST → user session cleared; navbar swapped to Login/Sign Up.
2) Product Browsing & Filtering
  * Home and Shop pages load with product cards (image, name, price + “per item/pack” label).
  * Category routes: Alloy (/shop/alloy/) and Track Edition (/shop/track/) show correct subsets.
  * Filters:
  * Brand (/shop/brand/<brand>/) – BBS/OZ Racing/Enkei/Fox show expected products.
  * Size (/shop/size/17%22…20%22/) – correct size subsets.
  * Weight (/shop/weight/7-10…13-17/) – correct weight subsets.
  * Product details show: price, optional compare-at price, pack size label, long description, delivery estimate.
3) Cart — Add/Update/Remove
  * “Add to Cart” from listing & detail → non-blocking toast confirmation; cart badge updates.
  * Cart page shows each line: image, title, unit price + “per item/pack”, qty control, line subtotal, remove button.
  * Quantity update (± and direct input) → totals recalc immediately on submit; invalid values rejected safely.
  * Remove item → item row disappears, totals update; empty cart state handled.
4) Checkout (Stripe session)
  * “Checkout” launches create-checkout-session; redirects to Stripe.
  * Success flow returns to /shop/checkout/success/:
  * Order recorded (Order + CartItems), totals correct.
  * Success page shows order summary.
  * Email confirmation attempted; on SMTP failure, safe warning toast shown (order still succeeds).
  * Cancel flow returns to cart without creating an order.
5) Order History
  * /shop/my-orders/ requires auth → unauthenticated users redirected to login.
  * Authenticated users see a list of their orders only (date, item count, total).
  * Links to order detail (if present) show the correct items and totals.
6) Contact Form
  * /shop/contact/ accepts name, email, message.
  * Valid submission → success toast; record saved to DB (Contact model).
  * Invalid submission (missing fields) → field errors shown; no DB write.
  * (If SMTP configured) message email sent; failures don’t break request.
7) SEO & Static Assets
  * robots.txt served as text/plain with sitemap link.
  * sitemap.xml renders and includes product + static routes.
  * <head> contains descriptive meta tags, canonical URL, Open Graph tags.
  * Favicon served in production (verified after collectstatic).
  * WhiteNoise serves static files with hashed filenames; DEBUG=False works.
8) Security & CSRF
  * All POST forms include {% csrf_token %} (login, signup, cart actions, contact, newsletter if enabled).
  * Auth-only routes (order history, checkout success tied to session) aren’t accessible to anonymous users.
  * ALLOWED_HOSTS and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS include the Heroku domain.
  * Cookies use Secure + SameSite=Lax in production.
9) Responsiveness & UX
  * Navbar collapses on mobile; menus and dropdowns usable by touch.
  * Toast notifications appear position-fixed top-right and auto-hide; no layout shift.
  * Product grid reflows at typical breakpoints; buttons remain reachable.
10) Deployment Checks (Heroku)
  * Procfile: web: gunicorn fly_wheels.wsgi:application.
  * .python-version set; requirements.txt compatible (no platform-specific wheels).
  * SECRET_KEY, SMTP, Stripe keys set via Heroku Config Vars (no secrets in repo).
  * python manage.py collectstatic --noinput succeeds; app boots without DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC.
